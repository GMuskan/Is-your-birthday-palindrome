# Is your birthday palindrome
This app takes only your date of birth as input and as a result it tells whether your birthday is palindrome or not.
Palindrome string : string is equal to the reverse of itself.

This app first takes your D.O.B as input -> convert it to string -> then check whether the reverse of it is equal to the actual converted string or not. If they both are equal then it returns 'your birthday is palindrome' otherwise it will answer in negation plus the number of days you missed to make your birthday palindrome.
